:::tip Disambiguation: Predicate vs. Edge vs. Field

It is common for these three terms to be interchnaged by many Dgraph engineers
and developers.

The term `Edge` is uniquely to define just the relationships between two nodes
of the graph.

The term `Predicate` is broadly known as either an Edge or a Predicate, but
specifically refers to a scalar or list of scalar values in a graph.

The term `Field` is a GraphQL term to refer to either an Edge or Predicate.
There is no distinction to Field whether it is an edge or a scalar, or a list of
scalars or edges.

Given this schema:

```GraphQL
type Person {
  name: String!
  hobbies: [String]
  friends: [Person]
  address: Address
}
```

Collectively, `name`, `hobbies`, `friends`, and `address` are are known as
`fields` and broadly known as `predicates` in Dgraph terminology.

But, specifically, `name` and `Hobbies` are edges, because they form the
relationships between two or more Persons or a Person and an Address.
