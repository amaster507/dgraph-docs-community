# GraphQL vs. DQL

One of the purposes of these community docs was to help with this main key
concept and help guide you on your development path using Dgraph. If you go to
the official Dgraph Docs, you will notice that the docs are split between
GraphQL and DQL.

- [Official Dgraph DQL Docs](https://dgraph.io/docs/dql/)

## What is DQL?

If this is your first time to Dgraph, you may have heard of GraphQL before, but
what is DQL?

**DQL** is Dgraph Query Language developed by Dgraph. It was originally named
_graphql+-_, but this was changed over time to prevent even more confusion
between GraphQL and DQL.

If this is your first time hearing about GraphQL, that is not a problem either
as these community docs will start at ground zero for the GraphQL beginners and
serve as a GraphQL fundamental review for GraphQL experts.

## Why the need for DQL?

GraphQL is a great language structure for working with an API, but it was never
intended to be used as a database query language. Dgraph liked GraphQL and chose
to fashion their graph database language around the concepts of GraphQL, but add
in their own unique syntax structures to develop a language that can be used to
handle core database functions.

Before Dgraph version 20.03, which began the calendar versioning of Dgraph, the
core of Dgraph only had endpoints for DQL and was lacking a spec-compliant
GraphQL endpoint. Anybody who wanted to have a GraphQL API to use for their
front-end applications had to write their own backend layer with their own
resolvers. Version 20.03 brought the spec-compliant GraphQL endpoint into the
core of Dgraph, without removing the DQL endpoints. The GraphQL endpoint could
be understood as a layer around the DQL endpoints because it takes the GraphQL
queries and mutations and rewrites them to DQL. I say it is not wrapping layer
though because it is all inside of the core of the Dgraph codebase. The
functions live together in the same repo and are deployed as a single
self-contained database having both the DQL and GraphQL endpoints.

:::tip No DQL Needed :)

Since Dgraph v. 20.03, you can start using Dgraph without needing any DQL.

You can deploy and start using Dgraph with only a working knowledge of GraphQL,
as you will see in these docs.

So when might you need to use DQL? Here are a few scenarios when to use DQL:

- Ingesting data in bulk
- Dropping data in bulk
- Using Dgraph for loosely typed or untyped data
- Migrating data after schema changes

## Using GraphQL and DQL together.

It is possible to use GraphQL and DQL together. These community docs are
focusing specically on GraphQL, but will contain tidbits and advanced topics to
help show you what you need to know to use these two languages together.

If you want a side by side comparison for DQL and GraphQL along with pointers of
when to use which one, then check the blog post:
