# Nodes: An Object in the Graph.

:::tip

The term `Object` can be ambiguous. In this context, we are using Object the
same way it is used in the term `JSON`. If you are familiar already with
GraphQL, you will know that all responses to GraphQL queries and mutations are
returned in a JSON formatted string.

:::

# Fields: Properties of Types.

Some commonly refer to fields as properties to align with other programming
languages where objects have properties.

# Types: Collections of Fields.

```GraphQL
type Person {
  name: String!
  hobbies: [String]
  friends: [Person]
  address: Address
}
```
