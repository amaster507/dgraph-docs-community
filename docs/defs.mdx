# Terms and Definitions

We need somewhere to link to when defining uncommon or easily misunderstood
terms. So here this is:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Term</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>node</td>
      <td>
        A singular entry point in the database. Uniquely identified with a uid.
        Equivalent to NoSQL as a document, or RDBMS as a row.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>server-node</td>
      <td>
        A server running either a Dgraph zero or alpha service. In a distributed
        configuration, there will be multiple server-nodes, but in a standalone
        configuration, a single server-node will run both the zero and alpha
        services.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>uid</td>
      <td>
        A unique identifier, 64bit integer represented in hexadecimal form, that
        is unique within the scope of a Dgraph Cluster. Not to be confused with
        UUID which are universally unique identifiers and outside of the scope
        of Dgraph.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>alpha service</td>
      <td>
        The data processing/storing algorithms service. Distribution happens by
        spinning up alpha services in groups of 3 each in their own dedicated
        machine with their own hard disk
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>zero service</td>
      <td>
        The cluster manager service. Every instance of a Dgraph must have a zero
        service running even if it is not distributed.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
