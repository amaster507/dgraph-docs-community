We say GraphQL as a Service (**GaaS**), but it is so much more than just
GraphQL. Dgraph Cloud is a complete Backend as a Service (**BaaS**). If it were
just a GaaS then it would not be a complete data store but merely a layer on top
of another Database as a Service (**DBaaS**). Dgraph is uniquely positioned
against all its competitors to provide a complete BaaS complete with
Authorization middleware, cache, and ready to scale!

## What is Missing from Dgraph Cloud?

Dgraph is a greate service, but it is not all roses without thorns. Depending on
your use cases you may find a need for additional backend functionality that is
not provided by Dgraph Cloud at this time. To be clear, here are a few things
that Dgraph Cloud cannot do at the moment without additional workarounds and
potentially requiring 3rd party services.

### File Storage

Dgraph Cloud does not have a file storage system. Users have found that they can
use S3 storage or other 3rd party file storage services and save the links to
files in the graph instead of the file themselves. It is possible for Dgraph to
store very long textual data and it is thoeretical possible to store files in
their binary form as textual strings although Dgraph does not officially
recommend this usage.

### Authentication

Dgraph does allow you to store user data and has mechanisms to store passwords,
but Dgraph does not currently have built in methods to generate jwt tokens to be
used with GraphQL auth rules. Users have used 3rd party authentication services
such as Auth0 and Firebase, or have even created their own authentication
scripts against the Dgraph database itself.

### Input Validation

While GraphQL does do strict type checking, there is lacking any additional
directives built into Dgraph at this time to perform input validation. Input
validation involves checking inputs against rules such as strings must be an
email, or integer must be within a range, or a list must contain at least one
value. Users have made attempts to do some input validation using auth rule
workarounds, but it does not provide a complete solution at this time.

For some of these use cases, you may find yourself needing a backend wrapper
around Dgraph Cloud which is feasable to setup with Apollo Federation.
